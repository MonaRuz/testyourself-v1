Test Yourself

  The application was created using the React, RTK, React Hook Form, React Query and Tailwind libraries and Firebase serves as the backend. This application serves as learning tool for self-testing knowledge acquired in any field. It allows you to enter your own questions and answers and then run the test. You can also save the ongoing test and highscore.

How to use Test Yourself app?

  To access the application, you must register or log in with your email and password. Each user only sees the categories and questions they have created. After logging in, you will see your dashboard, where you can see your categories. Here you can also create any number of categories, i.e. groups of questions. When you select one of the categories, you will see its overview, which shows the total number of questions in the category, your progress in the saved test, and your current score in %,  as well as the highest score achieved in that category which can be reset. There is also a list of all questions and answers in the category, sorted alphabetically by question and searchable using the search bar above the list. Each question can be clicked on to display the answer and the option to edit or delete the question and answer. At the top of the overview, you then have the option to run the test (only if you have any questions in the category), add more questions and answers, and delete the entire category. After clicking the RUN TEST button, you will see instructions before starting and, if you have already saved a test, the option to reset this test.

How does the test work?

  The test takes all the questions and answers from the category you selected and saves them to local storage in your browser. Therefore, it is very important not to clear your browser history, as you will then lose the ability to return to the saved test. After starting the test, a random question will be displayed, with the DISPLAY CORRECT ANSWER and SAVE TEST options below it. For each question, try to make your answer as close as possible to the answer you entered when creating the question. You can write your answer on paper for greater accuracy. After you have completed your answer, you can have the correct answer displayed and use it to evaluate whether your answer was correct or incorrect. At this point, additional buttons for correct or incorrect answers will appear. After clicking the CORRECT ANSWER button, this question will be deleted from the list of questions in local storage, i.e. from the list for the test, and will not appear again in this test. You will then be presented with another random question. If you click the WRONG ANSWER button, you will be presented with another random question, but this incorrectly answered question will be randomly repeated throughout the test until you mark it as correctly answered. The test ends when all questions are marked as correctly answered, which may take some time, which is why there is an option to save the test. During the test, the number of incorrectly and correctly answered questions is saved and at the end of the test your success rate is displayed in %, and if necessary it is saved as a highscore. At the end of the test, your highscore is displayed for comparison if you have not reached it. You can also track your progress and success during the test.

Why is this app so useful?

  1) You have to write the questions and answers yourself, which forces you to have a greater understanding of the issue.
  2) This is not a quiz. At the end of the test, you will not only be able to choose the correct answer, but you will also be able to talk more about the topic.
  3) Repeating incorrectly answered questions and filtering out correctly answered questions allows you to focus on the questions that are causing you the most trouble.
  4) New questions can be added to categories, so you can learn something new while not forgetting your previous knowledge.
  5) You have unlimited topic options. You can add as many categories as you want and they can cover any area of ​​education.
